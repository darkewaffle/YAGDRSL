# Building a Job Logic File
The purpose of a job logic file is to have a place where you can keep all of your custom code for each job. However even though we're calling it 'custom code' it can actually be quite simple. YAGDRSL has a number of functions available to you that will do a lot of the work to setup mods, bind keys, track buffs, automatically cancel buffs when using an action and more.

*[Click here for a full list of the user-facing functions](https://github.com/darkewaffle/YAGDRSL/blob/main/documentation/resources/functions.md) or [click here for some example job files to see how they can be setup](https://github.com/darkewaffle/YAGDRSL/tree/main/samples/jobfiles) if you'd prefer to learn by looking through them.*

So what should we put in the logic file? The most useful parts are probably all related to setting up your mods so let's start there. [*If you're not sure what 'mods' means then check out the full documentation on what a mod is and how it's used in YAGDRSL.*](https://github.com/darkewaffle/YAGDRSL/blob/main/documentation/Mods.md) Additional mod documentation has been consolidated into the [Making Mods page](https://github.com/darkewaffle/YAGDRSL/blob/main/documentation/Making%20Mods.md) to better address how mods can be created and customized in both the character and job logic files.

## Trackers
Trackers are very similar to mods in terms of how they affect gearsets but the user doesn't need to interact with them directly. You can't cycle a tracker or set it's value. Instead it will track something like a buff or a pet name and automatically update the value it contains. Trackers belong in a job logic file but if you want to find out what can be tracked and how to enable them then [refer to the Tracker documentation](https://github.com/darkewaffle/YAGDRSL/blob/main/documentation/Trackers.md).

And with that we've covered the basics of what can and should be in your job logic file. However there are a lot of other useful things you can do here if you decide to dive further into the library or .lua. If you would like to see some complete example files or get some ideas about what more advanced implementation can do then [have a look at the Making a Job Logic File That's Fancy documentation](https://github.com/darkewaffle/YAGDRSL/blob/main/documentation/Building%20a%20Job%20Logic%20File%20That's%20Fancy.md) or [check out some of the library's sample files](https://github.com/darkewaffle/YAGDRSL/tree/main/samples/jobfiles).
