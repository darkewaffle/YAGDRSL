# Today I Learned
## Collections
YAGDRSL maintains an internal collection of various widely used gearsets. They're just a convenient shorthand to help get new jobs up and running or so you don't have to remember if a Nyame body piece is "Nyame Mail" or "Nyame Chainmail" or "Nyame Cuirass", etc. Currently it contains the following armor sets (no weapons are included).

```
collections.Agwu

collections.Ikenga
collections.Malignance
collections.Mpaca
collections.Null
collections.Nyame
