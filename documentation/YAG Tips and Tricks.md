# Today I Learned
## Collections
YAGDRSL maintains an internal collection of various widely used gearsets. They're just a convenient shorthand to help get new jobs up and running or so you don't have to remember if a Nyame body piece is "Nyame Mail" or "Nyame Chainmail" or "Nyame Cuirass", etc. Currently it contains the following armor sets (no weapons are included).

```
collections.Agwu
collections.Bunzi
collections.Gleti
collections.Ikenga
collections.Malignance
collections.Mpaca
collections.Null
collections.Nyame
collections.Sakpata
```

## Keybinds
Any keybinds set by YAGDSRL functions will accept the same [keybind syntax used by Windower.](https://docs.windower.net/commands/input/) [Here is a link to the full list of keys as well.](https://docs.windower.net/commands/keymapping/)
