1. bloodpact pending flag > set during precast and store set in global during midcast for bp, unset on aftercast or pet change and unset global gearset
if other actions initiate when bp_pending then
    if pendingbpblockall then terminate

    if pendingbpallowprecast then precast
        midcast equip BPmidcast in global
     
    if pendingBPmidcastpriorityBP revert to bp midcast during next midcast

    if pendingBPmidcastpriorityBP = false then midcast proceed

global action pending during precast and unset on aftercast - halt status updates?

2. player loaded sidecar logic/file. restore core tables after onload, player can run a load command to do something out of the ordinary and then run a restore command.

3. precast intercept TP validation - spellattribute TP price - tricky to account for all the ways that TP necessary can be reduced by gear/effects. can conditionally check for presence of known gear providing effects in the precast set
if terminations are moved to be evaluated after the set is constructed
if category = step and stepcostreduction[precastset.feet] then TP price = TP price - 200
also check WS range for termination

4. formatting of static mapping files

5. aggregate all meaningful/useful for multiple applications set/index declarations

6. validate requires

7. layering of get_player / get_target / get_mob

8. location(s) of UpdateDisplayModOrders

9. reconsider how to better handle staggered/nested onload coroutines
