### Quick Start Guide
1. Download the YAG_include.lua file and the entire YAGDRSL folder.
2. Place them in your C:\Program Files (x86)\Windower\addons\GearSwap\libs folder
3. In the libs folder create a .lua file with the same name as your character. (eg: If your character is John then create John.lua).
4. Follow the examples in [the sample character file](https://github.com/darkewaffle/YAGDRSL/blob/main/3_YAGDRSL_FLOW.md) to create your character file.
5. When created correctly the character file will then load your job files and you are up and running.
